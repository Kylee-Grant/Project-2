# Project Requirements
1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.


# Inspiration:
In the project, we wanted to understand to a greater extent an issue that particularly impacts young women. Using the dataset identified above, we are intending to analyze the trends related to teen pregnancies/births among 15–19-year olds across the US by county.

As time allows, we are interested in incorporating supplemental information--either via a visualization or citations--on contraception access or Title X services provided.
